        <h3>Major: Computer Science</h3>
        <div>
        <p>The UNL Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)
            offers Nebraska's only comprehensive program of higher education,
            research, and service outreach in computer science and computer
            engineering.</p>
        <p>The CSE department offers a challenging baccalaureate degree program
            in computer science that prepares graduates for professional practice
            as computer scientists, provides the basis for advanced studies in
            the field, and establishes a foundation for life-long learning and
            achievement. The BS degree in computer science is accredited by the
            Computing Accreditation Commission of <a href="http://www.abet.org">ABET</a>.
      </div>
      <h3>Major: Computer Engineering</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The focus of the program is integrated hardware/software system design.
            Increasingly, diverse systems, products, and processes depend on computers
            for design, control, data acquisition, and other functions. The computer
            engineer possesses the range of expertise to have an integrated view of
            computer-based systems and to make global design decisions.</p>
        <p>Consistent with these goals, the computer science baccalaureate
            program develops:
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to solve a wide range of computing-related problems. Studies include mathematical foundations, computer science theory, programming and software design, system components and design, application of theory, experimentation, design tools and techniques, and documentation and maintenance.</li>
              <li>The ability to work with professionals in fields related to computing and/or having computing applications. Studies include natural sciences and the completion of at least one minor.</li>
              <li>Skills to quickly adapt to new work environments, assimilate new information, and solve new problems. Studies include application of theory, experimentation, design tools and techniques, documentation and maintenance, and technical communications.</li>
              <li>The background and perspective necessary to pursue post-graduate education. Studies include computer science theory, application of theory, experimentation, and life-long learning/professional development.</li>
              <li>Abilities to work in conformance with societal needs and expectations. Studies include liberal arts and ethical/social issues.</li>
              <li>Insight into the world of practicing professionals for collaborations, mutual support, and representing the profession to government and society. Studies include teamwork and life-long learning/professional development, plus students are provided multiple opportunities for involvement in organizations such as ACM and UPE; undergraduate research; and service to the department and community.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Minor: Computer Science</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering offers a Plan A, 18
            credit hour minor in Computer Science.  This minor will expose students
            to a breadth of Computer Science topics.  A CS minor is an excellent
            addition to any area of study and provides very marketable skills to
            graduates.
        </p>
        </div>
      <h3>Minor: Computational Biology &amp; Bioinformatics</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) Minor is an
            interdisciplinary program that prepares students to understand,
            use, and develop advanced computational methods and tools for
            processing, visualizing, and analyzing biological data and for
            modeling biological processes. Studies in computational biology
            and bioinformatics involve biosciences, computer science, engineering,
            mathematics, and statistics. Students will be prepared for careers
            in biomedical, biotechnology, agricultural, pharmaceutical, and
            engineering fields and for related graduate studies.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Minor: Robotics Engineering</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Beginning in fall 2014, the UNL College of Engineering is offering a
           new minor in Robotics Engineering, incorporating courses from several
           college areas: mechanical engineering, computer engineering and
           electrical engineering. The minor is available for students on the
           Lincoln and Omaha campuses.
        </p>
        </div>
      <h3>Minor: Software Development</h3>
        <div>
        <p>The past decades have witnessed a remarkable transition in how widely
            computing is applied across many domains of human activity.   As the
            uses of computing spread, it becomes increasingly important for people
            from diverse backgrounds to be trained in the key concepts underlying
            software-intensive systems.   Producing a small workforce of highly
            skilled computing experts is no longer sufficient to meet the growing
            demand for familiarity and competency with software development in
            the work force. Fortunately, the core body of knowledge surrounding
            software has stabilized to allow the development of a novel focused
            curriculum to cross-train domain experts in the key principles and
            practices of software development.
